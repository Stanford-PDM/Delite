1. Create BRAM interface out of registers
2. Create BRAMs out of DFEVector<DFEVar> for better chaining and utilization
3. Use DFEStruct interface of LMemCommandStream.makeKernelOutput() instead of
the DFEVar interface

Functionality improvements
1. Add parallelization to TileMemSt (benchmark output bandwidth)
2. Change base address input to TileMemLd and TileMemSt to be a DFEVar (the API
   supports it, this restriction is unnecessary)
